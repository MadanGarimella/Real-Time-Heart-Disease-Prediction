# Real-Time-Heart-Disease-Prediction
The project titled "Machine Learning for Real-Time Heart Disease Prediction" focuses on detecting heart anomalies from ECG data using machine learning. The system processes ECG signals in real-time, extracting features and applying the XGBoost algorithm to classify heart conditions into seven categories: Normal, AF (Atrial Fibrillation), Tachycardia, Bradycardia, Arrhythmia, Other, and Noisy. The model achieves high accuracy (99%) and is trained using a dataset of ECGs from multiple sources.

Programming Languages Used:

Python (main language for coding and implementing the model)
XGBoost (a Python library for machine learning)â€‹
